## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **OJT Route**, a web-based student OJT tracking and management system for Carlos Hilado Memorial State University (CHMSU). It serves as the single source of truth for development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

OJT Route employs a **traditional monolithic PHP architecture** with server-side rendering, designed for rapid development by a small team (3 students) within a 12-week capstone timeline. This architecture prioritizes simplicity, maintainability, and cost-effectiveness while delivering the core features needed to digitize CHMSU's OJT monitoring process.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- **Monolithic MVC Pattern:** Single codebase with PHP backend handling both business logic and HTML rendering
- **Server-Side Rendering:** Traditional multi-page application (not SPA) for better SEO and simpler deployment
- **Shared Hosting Deployment:** Optimized for Hostinger's shared hosting environment (no Docker, no Node.js server)
- **Mobile-First Responsive Design:** Bootstrap 5.3+ ensures excellent mobile experience for students in the field
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Core functionality works without JavaScript; JS enhances UX

### 1.1 Starter Template or Existing Project

**N/A - Greenfield Project**

OJT Route is a **custom-built capstone project** starting from scratch. No existing starter templates or frameworks are being used beyond standard libraries (Bootstrap for UI, PHPMailer for emails, Leaflet.js for maps).

**Rationale:** The team opted for vanilla PHP (no Laravel/Symfony) to:
1. Maximize learning about core web development concepts
2. Minimize framework overhead and complexity
3. Ensure compatibility with Hostinger's shared hosting environment
4. Meet capstone requirements for demonstrable technical knowledge

## 2. High Level Architecture

### 2.1 Technical Summary

**OJT Route** is a **traditional monolithic web application** built with **PHP 8.0+** and **MySQL 8.0+**, deployed on **Hostinger shared hosting**. The system follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern** with server-side rendering, delivering HTML pages directly from PHP without a separate frontend framework.

The architecture is designed for **simplicity and rapid development**, leveraging proven technologies that require minimal infrastructure. Students access the system via mobile browsers (primary interface), where they use HTML5 Geolocation API and camera access for GPS-verified attendance with photo capture. Bootstrap 5.3+ provides responsive UI components that adapt seamlessly from 360px mobile screens to desktop displays.

**Key integration points** include PHPMailer for SMTP email notifications (Gmail), Leaflet.js for interactive map interfaces (OpenStreetMap tiles), and the HTML5 Geolocation API for workplace verification using the Haversine Formula (40m radius enforcement). All user data, documents, and photos are stored on the server filesystem, with metadata in MySQL and file paths in the database.

The system achieves PRD goals through **role-based access control** (student/instructor/admin dashboards), **compliance gates** (document approval blocks attendance), **pattern detection** (identifying at-risk students), and **bulk operations** (CSV registration, batch approvals)â€”all orchestrated through PHP business logic and database triggers.

### 2.2 Platform and Infrastructure Choice

**Platform:** Hostinger Shared Hosting (Premium or Business plan)  
**Key Services:**
- **Web Server:** Apache with mod_rewrite (URL routing)
- **PHP:** Version 8.0+ (object-oriented features, type declarations)
- **Database:** MySQL 8.0+ (InnoDB engine, foreign keys)
- **Email:** SMTP relay via Gmail (not Hostinger SMTP due to reliability)
- **SSL:** Free Let's Encrypt certificate (auto-renewal)
- **Storage:** 100GB SSD (ample for documents/photos)
- **Control Panel:** cPanel with phpMyAdmin, FTP, file manager

**Deployment Host and Regions:** Hostinger data center in Singapore (closest to Philippines for optimal latency)

### 2.3 Repository Structure

**Structure:** Monorepo (single Git repository)  
**Monorepo Tool:** N/A (simple folder structure, no Nx/Turborepo needed)  
**Package Organization:** Traditional PHP project structure with separation of concerns

### 2.5 Architectural Patterns

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** - Server-side MVC separating data models, business logic, and presentation templates
- **Repository Pattern** - Abstract database access through Repository classes
- **Service Layer** - Reusable business logic encapsulated in Service classes
- **Front Controller Pattern** - Single entry point routes all requests to appropriate controllers
- **Active Record (Simplified)** - Model classes map to database tables with CRUD methods
- **Template View Pattern** - PHP templates render HTML with embedded PHP for dynamic content
- **Session-Based Authentication** - PHP sessions store user state; cookies for "remember me"
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** - Middleware checks user role before allowing access to pages/features
- **Queue-Based Email Processing** - Emails stored in database queue, processed by cron job asynchronously
- **Compliance Gate Pattern** - Middleware checks prerequisites before allowing feature access

5. System uploads and compresses photo
6. System creates attendance record with GPS coordinates and photo path
7. System updates student's total hours

### 7.2 Document Submission and Approval Workflow
1. Student uploads filled document
2. System validates file type and size
3. System stores file and updates student_documents table
4. System queues email notification to instructor
5. Instructor reviews document and approves/requests revision

3. Service executes business logic
4. Repository performs database operation
5. Errors are caught and logged
6. User receives appropriate error message

### 15.2 Error Response Format
```json
{
    "success": false,
    "error": {
        "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
        "message": "GPS accuracy too low. Move outdoors and try again.",
        "details": {
            "field": "accuracy",
            "value": 25.5,
            "max_allowed": 20
        },
        "timestamp": "2025-10-05T10:30:00Z",
        "requestId": "req_123456789"
    }
}
```
