# Project Brief: OJT Route

**Project Name:** OJT Route - Student OJT Tracking & Monitoring System  
**Project Type:** Capstone Project (Computer Studies - IS/IT)  
**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Planning Phase

---

## Executive Summary

**OJT Route** is a comprehensive web-based system that transforms On-the-Job Training (OJT) management for educational institutions. By eliminating manual, paper-based processes and implementing advanced geofencing technology with photo verification, the system ensures attendance integrity while providing complete transparency in student progress tracking.

**Core Innovation:** Real-time geolocation validation with 40-meter radius enforcement and photo capture prevents attendance fraud while enabling students to submit documents digitally, eliminating the need for physical school visits.

**Target Impact:** Saves students time and money, provides instructors with powerful monitoring tools, and gives administrators complete program oversight.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

**For Students:**
- Must physically travel to school to submit OJT documents (time-consuming, expensive)
- No real-time visibility into accumulated OJT hours
- Unclear document submission status
- Manual attendance tracking prone to errors

**For Instructors:**
- Heavy administrative burden managing multiple students across different workplaces
- Difficult to verify actual workplace attendance
- Time-consuming document review process
- No early warning system for struggling students

**For Administrators:**
- Limited visibility into program-wide OJT status
- Manual consolidation of reports
- Attendance fraud concerns
- Compliance documentation challenges

### Business Impact

- **Time Waste:** Students spend 2-4 hours per week traveling to school for submissions
- **Lack of Transparency:** No real-time tracking of progress toward 600-hour requirement
- **Fraud Risk:** Manual attendance systems vulnerable to manipulation
- **Administrative Overhead:** Instructors spend 30-40% of time on OJT paperwork
