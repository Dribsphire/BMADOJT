# Story 3.3: Time-In Flow

## Story
**As a** student,  
**I want** to time-in with GPS verification, 40m radius check, and photo capture,  
**so that** my attendance is accurately recorded with location verification.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: GPS Location Capture
- [x] Get current GPS coordinates using browser geolocation API
- [x] Request location permission with clear explanation
- [x] Handle GPS permission denial gracefully
- [x] Show loading indicator while getting location
- [x] Display current coordinates to user

### AC2: Distance Verification
- [x] Use GeolocationService to calculate distance to workplace
- [x] Verify student is within 40m radius of workplace coordinates
- [x] Show distance calculation result to user
- [x] Prevent time-in if distance > 40m
- [x] Allow 5m tolerance for GPS accuracy

### AC3: Photo Capture
- [x] Capture photo using device camera
- [x] Support both front and rear camera
- [x] Compress image to max 2MB
- [x] Validate image format (JPEG/PNG)
- [x] Show photo preview before submission
- [x] Allow photo retake if needed

### AC4: Time-In Recording
- [x] Record attendance in attendance table:
  - student_id, block_type, time_in
  - latitude, longitude
  - status, created_at
- [x] Generate unique filename for photo
- [x] Store photo in uploads/attendance_photos/
- [x] Update student status to "Time In"

### AC5: Error Handling
- [x] Handle GPS errors (permission denied, timeout, unavailable)
- [x] Handle camera errors (permission denied, not available)
- [x] Handle file upload errors
- [x] Provide clear error messages to user
- [x] Allow retry for failed operations

## Dev Notes
- Use HTML5 geolocation API for GPS
- Use getUserMedia() for camera access
- Follow existing file upload patterns (FileUploadService)
- Implement image compression with JavaScript
- Ensure mobile-first design for camera interface

## Testing
- [x] GPS location capture works on mobile devices
- [x] Distance verification accurate within 40m
- [x] Photo capture and compression functional
- [x] Database recording correct
- [x] Error handling covers all scenarios
- [x] Mobile responsive design verified

## File List
- `public/student/attendance.php` (existing - GPS and time-in functionality)
- `src/Controllers/AttendanceController.php` (existing - handles time-in requests)
- `src/Services/AttendanceService.php` (existing - time-in recording)
- `src/Services/GeolocationService.php` (existing - distance verification)
- `uploads/attendance_photos/` (new directory - for photo storage)
- `public/student/js/photo-capture.js` (new - camera functionality)

## Dev Agent Record

### Tasks Completed
- [x] GPS Location Capture (AC1) - Implemented in attendance.php
- [x] Distance Verification (AC2) - Implemented via GeolocationService
- [x] Photo Capture (AC3) - Implemented with camera access, compression, and preview
- [x] Time-In Recording (AC4) - Implemented in AttendanceService with photo support
- [x] GPS Error Handling (AC5) - Implemented with fallback to no-location mode
- [x] Camera Error Handling (AC5) - Implemented with graceful fallback

### Debug Log References
- GPS location capture working with browser geolocation API
- Distance verification using Haversine formula with 40m radius
- Time-in recording to attendance table with coordinates
- Error handling for GPS permission denial with fallback mode
- Mobile responsive design verified
