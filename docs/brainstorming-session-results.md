---

## Geolocation Implementation

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** JavaScript Geolocation API
- **Map Interface:** Leaflet + OpenStreetMap (free, open-source)
- **Distance Calculation:** Haversine formula (PHP backend)

### Workplace Location Setup (One-Time)

**Flow:**
1. Student/admin clicks "Set Workplace Location"
2. Map modal opens with search capability
3. User clicks on map to place marker
4. System shows 40m radius circle preview
5. Displays coordinates (lat/long)
6. User confirms ‚Üí Saves to database
7. Only admin can change after initial setup

**Features:**
- Search address functionality
- Drag map to navigate
- Visual 40m radius preview
- Current location detection

### Time-In Process

**Complete Flow:**
```
1. Student clicks "Time In" (Morning/Afternoon/Overtime)
2. Check internet connection (required)
3. Request GPS location (enableHighAccuracy: true)
4. Check GPS accuracy (reject if >50m accuracy)
5. Calculate distance to workplace (Haversine formula)
6. Factor GPS accuracy into distance (effectiveDistance = distance + accuracy)
7. If effectiveDistance > 40m ‚Üí BLOCK with distance shown
8. If within 40m ‚Üí Open camera for photo capture
9. Capture photo ‚Üí Auto-compress to 80% quality
10. Upload photo + location data ‚Üí Save to attendance table
11. Start work timer
12. Success message
```

### Time-Out Process

**Complete Flow:**
```
1. Student clicks "Time Out" (Morning/Afternoon/Overtime)
2. Check internet connection (required)
3. Request GPS location (enableHighAccuracy: true)
4. Check GPS accuracy (reject if >50m accuracy)
5. Calculate distance to workplace
6. Factor GPS accuracy into distance
7. If effectiveDistance > 40m ‚Üí BLOCK with distance shown
8. If within 40m ‚Üí NO PHOTO NEEDED
9. Save time-out timestamp + location ‚Üí Calculate hours worked
10. Add hours to student's ojt_total_hours
11. Stop work timer
12. Success message with hours worked
```

### Distance Validation (PHP)

**Haversine Formula:**
```php
function calculateDistance($lat1, $lon1, $lat2, $lon2) {
    $earthRadius = 6371000; // meters
    $latFrom = deg2rad($lat1);
    $lonFrom = deg2rad($lon1);
    $latTo = deg2rad($lat2);
    $lonTo = deg2rad($lon2);
    
    $latDelta = $latTo - $latFrom;
    $lonDelta = $lonTo - $lonFrom;
    
    $a = sin($latDelta / 2) * sin($latDelta / 2) +
         cos($latFrom) * cos($latTo) *
         sin($lonDelta / 2) * sin($lonDelta / 2);
    
    $c = 2 * atan2(sqrt($a), sqrt(1 - $a));
    
    return $earthRadius * $c; // Distance in meters
}
```

**With Accuracy:**
```php
function validateLocationWithAccuracy($currentLat, $currentLng, $accuracy, 
                                      $workplaceLat, $workplaceLng, $allowedRadius = 40) {
    $distance = calculateDistance($currentLat, $currentLng, $workplaceLat, $workplaceLng);
    $effectiveDistance = $distance + $accuracy;
    
    if ($effectiveDistance <= $allowedRadius) {
        return ['valid' => true, 'distance' => $distance, 'accuracy' => $accuracy];
    } else {
        return ['valid' => false, 'distance' => $distance, 'accuracy' => $accuracy,
                'message' => 'Too far from workplace'];
    }
}
```

### Error Handling

**Blocks Time-In/Time-Out:**
1. ‚ùå No internet connection
2. ‚ùå Location permission denied
3. ‚ùå GPS accuracy > 50 meters
4. ‚ùå Distance > 40m (with accuracy factored)
5. ‚ùå Camera access denied (time-in only)

**User-Friendly Messages:**
- "Internet connection required for attendance"
- "Please enable location permissions"
- "GPS signal too weak (¬±Xm). Move to an open area."
- "You are outside your workplace area. Distance: Xm (¬±Ym)"

### Key Design Decisions

‚úÖ **Hard 40m radius enforcement** (no flexibility)  
‚úÖ **GPS accuracy factored into validation** (prevents poor-signal time-ins)  
‚úÖ **Strict internet requirement** (no offline queuing)  
‚úÖ **Time-in: Location + Photo** (full verification)  
‚úÖ **Time-out: Location only** (streamlined process)

---

- Failed emails viewable with error messages
- Activity logging for all email sends

### Configuration Decisions

‚úÖ **No opt-out** - All notifications mandatory  
‚úÖ **Immediate batch sending** - All 30 section students emailed at once  
‚úÖ **Personal Gmail for testing** - Easy capstone setup  
‚úÖ **Admin dashboard monitoring** - Failed email widget
