## 1. Goals and Background Context

### 1.1 Goals

**OJT Route** aims to transform the manual, paper-based OJT monitoring process at CHMSU into a secure, efficient, and transparent digital system. The key goals are:

1. **Eliminate Manual Processes:** Replace physical attendance logs, paper-based document submission, and manual hour tracking with a centralized web application.

2. **Ensure Attendance Integrity:** Use GPS geofencing (40-meter radius) and real-time photo capture to verify students are physically present at their workplace during time-in, reducing attendance fraud.

3. **Provide Transparency:** Give students, instructors, and admins real-time visibility into OJT progress, attendance records, and document status through role-specific dashboards.

4. **Enable Digital Document Management:** Allow instructors to upload document templates with deadlines, students to submit documents digitally, and instructors to review/approve/revise submissions—eliminating trips to campus.

5. **Reduce Administrative Burden:** Enable bulk student/instructor registration via CSV, bulk document approvals, automated email notifications, and pattern detection to identify at-risk students.

6. **Save Student Time:** Allow students to submit documents remotely, track their hours digitally, and communicate with instructors through integrated messaging—no need to travel to campus just for paperwork.

7. **Deliver Proactive Monitoring:** Use pattern detection to identify students who consistently forget time-outs or miss deadlines, allowing instructors to intervene early.

8. **Scalable System:** Support 100+ students per section, multiple sections per instructor, and multiple instructors per admin, with performance optimized for mobile devices (primary user interface).

### 1.2 Background Context

**Current Situation:**

At Carlos Hilado Memorial State University (CHMSU), Computer Studies students (Information Systems and Information Technology programs) are required to complete 600 hours of On-the-Job Training (OJT) as part of their capstone requirements. The current process involves:

- **Manual Attendance:** Students maintain paper logbooks with supervisor signatures.
- **Physical Document Submission:** Students travel to campus to submit 7 required documents (MOA, endorsement letter, parental consent, etc.), weekly reports, and corrections.
- **Limited Visibility:** Instructors and admins have no real-time visibility into student progress, workplace location, or attendance patterns.
- **Time-Consuming:** Students waste hours traveling between workplace and campus just to submit paperwork.
- **Fraud Risk:** Paper-based systems are vulnerable to buddy-punching, falsified signatures, and inaccurate hour reporting.
- **Communication Gaps:** No structured way for students to report issues (e.g., forgot to time out) or for instructors to send section-wide announcements.

**Target Users:**

1. **Students** (~100+ per cohort): Need to track attendance, submit documents, communicate with instructors, and view their OJT progress.
2. **Instructors** (~5-10 per program): Need to monitor multiple sections, review documents, approve/reject submissions, handle "forgot time-out" requests, and communicate with students.
3. **Admin** (1-2 program coordinators): Need to register users, assign sections, oversee program-wide analytics, and intervene when students fall behind.

**Solution:**

OJT Route digitizes the entire workflow:
- GPS-verified attendance with 40m geofencing
- Real-time photo capture for time-ins
- Digital document templates, submissions, and approval workflow
- Private and group messaging with email notifications (PHPMailer)
- Pattern detection for proactive intervention
- Bulk operations for efficiency
- Mobile-first responsive design

## 4. Technical Assumptions

### 4.1 Repository Structure

**Monorepo:** All code (backend PHP, frontend HTML/CSS/JS) in a single Git repository.

**Folder Structure:**
```
/bmadOJT
├── /public           # Web root (index.php, assets)
│   ├── /css          # Stylesheets
│   ├── /js           # JavaScript files
│   └── /images       # Static images (logo, icons)
├── /src              # PHP classes (models, controllers, services)
│   ├── /models       # Database models (User, Attendance, Document)
│   ├── /controllers  # Business logic controllers
│   └── /services     # Utility services (EmailService, GeoService)

├── .env              # Environment variables (not in Git)
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
```

---

### 4.2 Service Architecture

**Monolith (MVC Pattern):** Traditional PHP application with Model-View-Controller structure.

**Rationale:** For a capstone project with 12-week timeline, monolithic architecture offers:
- Simpler deployment (single codebase, single server)
- Easier debugging
- Lower operational complexity
- Faster development (no API contracts, no CORS issues)

**Trade-off:** Less scalable than microservices, but adequate for 500-user target and manageable for a 3-person student team.

---

### 4.3 Testing Requirements

**Strategy:** Manual Testing + Critical Unit Tests

**Manual Testing:**
- Functional testing of all user workflows (login, registration, time-in, document upload, etc.)
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge on desktop; Chrome Mobile, Safari Mobile on mobile)
- Geofencing accuracy testing on real devices at actual workplace locations
- Security testing (SQL injection, XSS, file upload vulnerabilities)
- Performance testing (page load times, concurrent users)
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with 5-10 beta users

**Unit Tests (PHPUnit):**
- Critical functions only (Haversine formula, password hashing, file validation, email queue logic)
- Test coverage goal: 30-40% (focused on high-risk code)

**Rationale:** Capstone timeline (12 weeks) doesn't allow full TDD. Manual testing + critical unit tests balances quality with time constraints.

---

### 4.4 Additional Technical Assumptions

**Backend:**
- PHP 8.0+ (object-oriented, namespaces, type declarations)
- MySQL 8.0+ (InnoDB engine, foreign keys, indexes)
- Composer for dependency management (PHPMailer, optional libraries)

**Frontend:**
- HTML5 (semantic markup, Canvas API for camera)
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid for layouts)
- JavaScript ES6+ (async/await, fetch API, arrow functions)
- Bootstrap 5.3+ (responsive grid, components, utilities)
- Leaflet.js for interactive maps
- OpenStreetMap for map tiles (free, no API key required)

**Email:**
- PHPMailer library for SMTP email sending
- Gmail SMTP (smtp.gmail.com:587) with App Password
- Email queue table in MySQL for async processing

**Geolocation:**
- HTML5 Geolocation API (`navigator.geolocation`)
- Haversine Formula for distance calculation
- 40-meter radius geofencing (hardcoded, not configurable by users)

**Image Processing:**
- PHP GD Library or Imagick for image compression
- Compression: 80% JPEG quality, max 1MB file size

**Development Environment:**
- XAMPP (Apache, MySQL, PHP) for local development
- Visual Studio Code as primary IDE
- Git for version control, GitHub for repository hosting

**Deployment:**
- Hostinger shared hosting (selected for affordability and student access)
- FTP/SFTP for file upload
- phpMyAdmin for database management
- Free SSL certificate from Hostinger

---

### 4.5 Key Technical Trade-Offs

1. **Monolith vs. Microservices:** Chose monolith for simplicity and faster development. Trade-off: less scalable, but adequate for capstone scope.

2. **Vanilla JS vs. Frameworks (React/Vue):** Chose vanilla JS + Bootstrap for lower learning curve and faster prototyping. Trade-off: less maintainable at scale, but simpler for 3-person team.

3. **Server-Side Rendering vs. SPA:** Chose server-side rendering (PHP templates) for better SEO and simpler deployment. Trade-off: more page reloads, but adequate for use case.

4. **Manual Testing vs. Full TDD:** Chose manual testing + critical unit tests for time efficiency. Trade-off: higher bug risk, but realistic for capstone timeline.

5. **Free Tools vs. Paid Services:** Chose OpenStreetMap (free) over Google Maps API (paid), Gmail SMTP (free) over SendGrid (paid). Trade-off: potential rate limits, but zero cost for student project.

---

## 5. Epic List

### Overview

The development of OJT Route is structured into **6 epics**, spanning **12 weeks** of development with continuous testing and integration. Each epic delivers a cohesive unit of user-facing functionality, allowing for incremental demos and early feedback.

---

### Epic 1: Foundation, User Management & Basic Dashboards
**Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Goal:** Set up project infrastructure, implement user registration/authentication, role-based access control, profile management, section management, and basic data-table-based dashboards.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Database schema (10 tables) + migration script
- Default admin account seeded
- Bulk CSV registration (students, instructors)
- Manual registration
- School ID login system
- Profile management (all roles)
- Student workplace setup (interactive map)
- Section CRUD
- Basic dashboards with data tables

**Why First?** Foundation must be in place before any feature can be built. Authentication and user management are prerequisites for all subsequent epics.

---

### Epic 2: Document Management & Workflow
**Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Goal:** Implement the complete document lifecycle—pre-loaded templates, instructor uploads with deadlines, student download/upload, instructor review/approval/revision, resubmission flow, compliance gate, and document monitoring dashboards.

**Key Deliverables:**
- 7 required documents pre-seeded
- Instructor document template upload (with optional deadlines)
- Student document list, download, upload
- Instructor review interface (approve/revise with feedback)
- Bulk approval
- Resubmission flow
- Document compliance gate (blocks attendance if <7 approved)
- Instructor document dashboard

**Why Second?** Document approval is a prerequisite for attendance (compliance gate). Building this before attendance ensures students can complete setup before needing to time in.

---

### Epic 3: Attendance System with Geofencing
**Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Goal:** Implement GPS-verified attendance with 40m geofencing, time-in with photo capture, time-out with location verification, forgot time-out requests, attendance history, and monitoring dashboards.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Geolocation service + Haversine Formula distance calculation
- Attendance page (block selection, status display)
- Time-in flow (GPS check, 40m radius, photo capture, compression)
- Time-out flow (GPS check, 40m radius, no photo)
- Forgot time-out request submission (with letter)
- Instructor forgot time-out review (approve/reject)
- Student attendance history
- Instructor section attendance overview
- Admin attendance reports + CSV export

**Why Third?** Attendance is the core WOW factor (#1). Building it after documents ensures the compliance gate is in place. Geofencing complexity requires dedicated sprint.

---

### Epic 4: Communication & Notifications
**Duration:** 1.5 weeks  
**Goal:** Implement private/group messaging with read receipts, PHPMailer email notifications for 11 event types, email queue system, notification history, and integration with forgot time-out workflow.

**Key Deliverables:**
- PHPMailer configuration + email service
- Private messaging (student ↔ instructor)
- Group chat (instructor → section, student replies)
- Read receipts
- Email notifications (document events, attendance events, system events)
- Email queue + async processing + retry logic
- Rate limiting (10 emails/hour)
- Notification history for all users
- FR39 integration (forgot time-out auto-creates message thread)

**Why Fourth?** Communication enhances earlier features (documents, attendance) but doesn't block them. Email notifications add polish and professionalism.

---

### Epic 5: Dashboard Enhancement, Analytics & Pattern Detection
**Duration:** 1.5 weeks  
**Goal:** Enhance dashboards with advanced analytics, pattern detection for at-risk students, student status labels, calendar view, quick action buttons, advanced search/filter, and export functionality.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Student status labels (On Track/Needs Attention/At Risk) with auto-calculation
- Pattern detection (recurring forgot time-outs, missed deadlines)
- Notification emails when patterns detected
- Enhanced instructor dashboard (real-time counters, calendar view, quick actions)
- Enhanced admin dashboard (program-wide analytics, missing documents report)
- Advanced search/filter (date ranges, status, hours vs required)
- Export to CSV for compliance

**Why Fifth?** Analytics and pattern detection are "nice-to-have" enhancements that showcase advanced capabilities. Building them after core features ensures time for polish.

---

### Epic 6: Polish, Testing & Deployment
**Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Goal:** Conduct comprehensive integration testing (cross-browser, GPS accuracy, security audit, performance optimization), UI/UX polish, email system testing, user acceptance testing (UAT), documentation (user guides), Hostinger deployment, and capstone demo preparation.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Cross-browser/device compatibility testing
- GPS accuracy testing on real devices
- Security audit (SQL injection, XSS, file upload, etc.)
- Performance optimization (query optimization, image compression, caching)
- UI/UX consistency pass
- Email system testing (all 11 types, queue processing)
- User Acceptance Testing (5-10 beta users)
- User documentation (student/instructor/admin guides)
- Hostinger deployment + production testing
- Capstone demo preparation + rehearsal

**Why Last?** Testing, polish, and deployment are the final steps to transform working features into a production-ready, demo-worthy capstone project.

---

### Rationale for Epic Sequencing

1. **Foundation First:** Epic 1 establishes infrastructure, user management, and authentication—prerequisites for all features.

2. **Documents Before Attendance:** Epic 2 (Documents) precedes Epic 3 (Attendance) because document compliance is a gate for attendance. Students must complete document setup before timing in.

3. **Core Features Before Enhancements:** Epics 1-3 deliver Must-Have features (user management, documents, attendance). Epics 4-5 add communication and analytics (Nice-to-Have but important for WOW factor).

4. **Communication After Attendance:** Epic 4 (Communication) integrates with Epic 3 (forgot time-out auto-creates message thread), so it comes after.

5. **Analytics Last of Features:** Epic 5 (Analytics) depends on data from Epics 2-4, so it comes after those are complete.

6. **Continuous Testing:** Epic 6 focuses on integration testing and deployment, but unit testing and manual testing occur continuously after each epic.

#### Story 1.5: Role-Based Access Control and Access Gates

**As the** system,  
**I want** to enforce role-based access control and specific access gates,  
**so that** users only see features appropriate to their role and readiness status.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Role-based routing enforced:**
   - `/admin/*` pages check if `$_SESSION['role'] == 'admin'`, else redirect to 403 or login
   - `/instructor/*` pages check if `$_SESSION['role'] == 'instructor' or 'admin'` (admin can switch), else redirect
   - `/student/*` pages check if `$_SESSION['role'] == 'student'`, else redirect
2. **Instructor access gate:**
   - When instructor logs in, system checks if `section_id IS NOT NULL` in their user record
   - If `section_id IS NULL`, redirect to `/instructor/no-section.php` with message: "You are not assigned to a section yet. Please contact the admin."
   - No access to instructor dashboard, students list, or any instructor features until section assigned
3. **Student workplace gate:**
   - Student can access profile page to set workplace info even if workplace_latitude/longitude are null
   - Attendance page checks if workplace coordinates are set
   - If null, show message: "Complete your workplace information in your profile before marking attendance."
   - Disable time-in/time-out buttons until workplace set
4. **Student document compliance gate:**
   - Attendance page queries `student_documents` for student's approved required documents
   - Required documents: 7 (MOA, Endorsement, Parental Consent, Misdemeanor Penalty, OJT Plan, Notarized Parental Consent, Pledge of Good Conduct)
   - If count < 7, show message: "You must submit and get approval for all 7 required documents before you can mark attendance."
   - Disable time-in/time-out buttons until 7/7 approved
5. **Admin role switching:**
   - Admin dashboard includes "Switch to Instructor Mode" button
   - When clicked, session updated with `$_SESSION['acting_role'] = 'instructor'`
   - Admin can access instructor features (if they have a section assigned to their user record)
   - "Switch Back to Admin" button to revert
6. Navigation menu dynamically shows links based on role (student menu vs instructor menu vs admin menu)
7. Unauthorized access attempts logged to `activity_logs` table
8. 403 error page displays friendly message: "You do not have permission to access this page."
9. Direct URL manipulation tested: attempting to access `/admin/dashboard.php` as student fails gracefully
10. All gates tested with various user states (instructor with/without section, student with 0-7 approved docs)

   - Success toast: "Profile updated successfully!"
   - Profile picture updates in navbar avatar immediately
6. On validation failure:
   - Error messages displayed above form
   - Example: "Email already in use by another account"
7. Password change section (optional, can defer to later):

---

### Top Issues by Priority

**BLOCKERS:** None  
**HIGH:** None  
**MEDIUM:** None  
**LOW:**
- Consider adding FAQ section for common dev questions
- Consider adding glossary for technical terms (Haversine, geofencing, RBAC, etc.)
- Consider creating visual user flow diagrams for key workflows (time-in, document approval)

---

### MVP Scope Assessment

**Features to Keep:** All Must-Have features are essential and well-justified.

**Features at Risk (if timeline pressures):**
- Calendar view of attendance (Nice-to-Have, can defer to post-launch)
- Advanced search/filter (core search/filter sufficient, advanced can defer)
- Pattern detection email notifications (detection can stay, email can defer)

**Missing Features:** None identified. All core OJT tracking needs are covered.

**Complexity Concerns:**
- Geofencing with 40m radius (Epic 3) - High complexity due to GPS accuracy variability. Mitigation: Dedicated testing on real devices (Story 6.2)
- Email queue with retry logic (Epic 4) - Moderate complexity. Mitigation: PHPMailer library handles heavy lifting.
- Image compression (Epic 1, 3) - Low complexity with GD Library.

**Timeline Realism:** 12 weeks is realistic for 3-person team with continuous testing. Epic breakdown (2-2-2-1.5-1.5-2 weeks) allows buffer time.

---

### Technical Readiness

**Clarity of Technical Constraints:** Excellent. All technology decisions justified.

**Identified Technical Risks:**
1. **GPS Accuracy Variability:** Real-world testing required to validate 40m radius enforcement. Mitigation: Story 6.2 includes multi-device, multi-location testing.
2. **Hostinger Resource Limits:** Shared hosting may have performance constraints. Mitigation: Story 6.4 includes load testing and resource monitoring.
3. **Email Delivery Reliability:** Gmail SMTP may flag bulk emails as spam. Mitigation: Email queue with retry logic (Story 4.1), sender reputation building.
4. **Browser Compatibility:** Camera and geolocation APIs have inconsistent support. Mitigation: Story 6.1 tests on all target browsers/devices.

**Areas Needing Architect Investigation:**
- Database indexing strategy for performance (identified in NFR3, to be implemented in Story 1.1)
- File cleanup strategy for old documents/photos (keep forever vs scheduled cleanup—decision documented)
- Session management approach (PHP native sessions acceptable, Redis unnecessary for MVP)

---

### Recommendations

**For PM (Product Manager):**
1. ✅ PRD is complete and ready for handoff to UX Expert and Architect
2. ✅ Schedule kickoff meeting with team to review PRD and answer questions
3. ✅ Create GitHub project board with 59 user stories from epics
4. ✅ Identify key milestones for stakeholder demos (end of Epic 1, 3, 6)
5. ✅ Prepare backup plan if timeline pressures arise (defer calendar view, advanced filters)

**For UX Expert:**
1. Design mobile-first UI mockups for critical screens (login, dashboard, attendance page, document submission)
2. Create interactive map prototype for workplace location setup
3. Define color palette usage across components (primary green, status colors)
4. Design responsive breakpoint behaviors (mobile, tablet, desktop)
5. Create loading states, empty states, and error state designs

**For Architect:**
1. Create detailed database schema with foreign keys, indexes, and constraints
2. Design folder structure for monolithic MVC architecture
3. Define routing strategy (URL structure, .htaccess rules)
4. Design service layer architecture (EmailService, GeoService, FileService)
5. Create security layer for RBAC enforcement
6. Document API contracts between controllers and views (if AJAX used)
7. Design cron job schedule for email queue processing

**For Development Team:**
1. Set up development environment (XAMPP, Git, VS Code) per README
2. Review Epic 1 stories and estimate effort for sprint planning
3. Identify any technical unknowns and schedule spike investigations
4. Set up code review process and branching strategy (feature branches, PR reviews)
5. Begin with Story 1.1 (database schema) immediately after architecture phase
